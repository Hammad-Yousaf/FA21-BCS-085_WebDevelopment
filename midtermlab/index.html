        <p>
            Israel's highest-ranking officer chief Herzi Halevi (left) has apologised for making a 'grave mistake' after
            his forces killed seven aid workers by bombing a clearly marked food convoy in Gaza. Former Royal Marines
            James Henderson (top right) and John Chapman (bottom right) and an ex-soldier named last night as James
            Kirby (centre right) were among the victims of the 'outrageous' drone strike that has triggered worldwide
            condemnation. Lt. Gen. Halevi expressed remorse over the killings, which he says were the result of a
            'misidentification' in complex conditions. He gave no further details. The IDF boss admitted the bombing
            'shouldn't have happened' and said an independent body would conduct a 'thorough investigation' that would
            be completed in the coming days. Aid agencies accused Israel of deliberately targeting their staff and
            experts, including the United Nations special
            rapporteur on human rights
            and counterterror, have warned
            the killing of WCK workers could be a war crime

                <p>The magnitude-7.4 quake struck just before 8:00 am local time (0000 GMT), with the United States
                    Geological Survey (USGS) putting the epicentre 18 kilometres (11 miles) south of Taiwan's Hualien
                    City, at a depth of 34.8 kilometres. Officials said the quake was the strongest to shake the island
                    in decades, and warned of more tremors in the days ahead. Three people among a group of seven on an
                    early-morning hike through the hills that surround the city were crushed to death by boulders
                    loosened by the earthquake, officials said. Separately, a truck driver died when his vehicle was hit
                    by a landslide as it approached a tunnel in the area, with three others later confirmed dead by
                    Taiwan's national fire agency. Social media was awash with shared video and images from around the
                    country of buildings swaying as the quake struck, while others partially collapsed and sprayed
                    debris into the streets.</p>
